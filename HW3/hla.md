**Problem 1:**<br>
Insertion sort utilizes a nested loop. It contains a while loop within a for loop. We go through each loop n times. The outer loop would be n and the inner loop is also n, which leads to n*n time + the other constant time stuff.

**Problem 2:**<br>
We have three for loops. We go through the outer loop n times, the seocnd inner loop n times, and the innermost loop n times so it comes out to be n*n*n time + the other constant times stuff.
