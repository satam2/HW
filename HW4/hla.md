**Problem 1:**<br>
Insertion sort utilizes a nested loop. It contains a while loop within a for loop so its looking like O(n^2). The worst case time complexity would be in the list is in reverse sorted order, so it would look through the entire array of length n and also would need to swap every element. The average case is also O(n^2). The best case scenario would be if the list is already sorted. In that case it would be O(n) time.<br>

**Problem 2:**<br>
Assuming the matrixes are square, we will assume the values of A and B are of value n. The time complexity for all cases for the program would be O(n^3). There is not really a best case because we have to go through the entire loop no matter what so the case is the time complexity is same for all-- best, average, worst.
